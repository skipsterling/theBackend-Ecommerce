# theBackend-Ecommerce

## Description
This app was created to make ecommerce easy. So i've created a back end e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies, nodejs, mysql, js.
Create, Add, Update and Delete products using this app. 

## Installation
To use this you will need to install the dependancies by running npm install on your cli.


## Usage 
Once your dependancies are installed you will need to create the server by removing the .EXAMPLE section from the .env.EXAMPLE file 
You can then create the database using the schema file located within the db file.
You can test the seed data by running npm run seed in the cli 
and to start the server you can use the command npm start.
The routes that will be available to the client will be:

CATEGORIES:
- GET All Categories
- GET Category by ID
- POST New Category
- PUT Update Category by ID
- DEL Delete Category

PRODUCTS:
- GET All Products
- GET Product by ID
- POST New Product
- PUT Update Product by ID
- DEL Delete Product by ID

TAGS:
